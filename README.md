# Personal Java compiler

This is a java compiler I created with a classmate Daniel May
and guidance of professor Ronald Garcia for CPSC411 Compiler construction.

This project is a compiler that accepts simple Java programs. The features
supported are a subset of all the feature offered in the Java language.

If you want me to take this repo down open an issue and I will immediately remove it.
